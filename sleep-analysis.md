# Sleep Analysis Dashboard

A focused view of sleep health over the past 30 days. Adjust `last` to zoom
in or out. For all renderer-specific arguments, defaults, and accepted values,
see `examples/visualization-reference.md`.

## Sleep Summary

type: intro-stats

```

## Sleep Schedule (Apple style)

Horizontal bars showing bedtime → wake time against a 24-hour axis.
Inner band is time actually asleep; outer band is total in-bed.

## Nightly Stage Breakdown

Stacked bars — each column is one night. Colors: deep (darkest) at the base,
then core, REM, and awake on top.

## Polar Clock

Each night occupies a clock-face arc. Useful for spotting consistent
sleep/wake times and stage patterns at a glance.

## Architecture Timeline

Linear stage timeline — one row per night. Drag the tooltip over a segment
to see exact stage and duration.

## HRV — Recovery Signal

HRV typically rises after good sleep and falls with poor recovery. Compare
dips here against the sleep bars above.

## Overnight Blood Oxygen

SpO2 during sleep hours. Dips below 94 % may indicate apnea events or
altitude effects.

## Overnight Respiratory Rate

Resting respiratory rate during sleep. A sustained increase of 2+ breaths/min
from your baseline is often an early sign of illness.

## Resting Heart Rate Context

Resting HR ring chart — useful to see how workout days (longer arcs)
relate to nights with fragmented sleep.
