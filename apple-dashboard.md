# Apple Health Dashboard

A complete Apple Health-inspired summary. Each section mirrors a card from
Apple's own Summary tab, using the Apple-style visualizations bundled with this
plugin. The whole page auto-anchors to today — adjust `last: N` values to widen
or narrow any section's window. For a full list of visualization arguments,
metric ids, and defaults, see `examples/visualization-reference.md`.

> **Tip:** Apple Health's Summary tab is a vertical feed on iPhone, so the
> layout below stacks top-to-bottom. Side-by-side cards can be arranged with
> any column/grid plugin if you want a denser layout.

## Today's Activity

Apple's iconic three rings — Move (red), Exercise (green), Stand (blue) —
closing clockwise from the top. The min-to-max heart rate capsule to the
right shows how hard your heart worked on each of those days.

## Trends — Last 90 Days

The Trends tab in Apple Health surfaces gradual shifts that day-to-day noise
hides. Green means you're improving on that metric's preferred direction:
rising HRV and active calories are good; rising resting HR is not.
